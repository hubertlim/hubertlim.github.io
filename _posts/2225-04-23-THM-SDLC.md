## [Task 2] SDLC

#### How many phases can an SDLC have? (Format X-Y)
```text
6-8
```
{: .nolineno }
{: file="Answer:" }

> Companies can choose to rearrange by splitting or unifying these into `6-8` phases. For example, we can merge the testing phase with the Development phase in scenarios where security is introduced in every development step, as developers fix bugs during testing.
{: .prompt-tip }

## [Task 3] SDLC Phases Part 1

#### What phase focuses on determining the first idea for a prototype?
```text
Requirements Definition
```
{: .nolineno }
{: file="Answer:" }

> A system's requirements stage (`Requirements Definition`) involves defining the prototype ideas and gathering all the necessary details.
{: .prompt-tip }

#### What stage is also known as the "Feasibility Stage"?
```text
Planning Stage
```
{: .nolineno }
{: file="Answer:" }

> As part of the Planning Phase, also known as the `Feasibility Stage`, the scope and purpose of the application are determined. 
{: .prompt-tip }

#### When do you outline the user interfaces and network requirements?
```text
Design and Prototyping
```
{: .nolineno }
{: file="Answer:" }

> In `Design and Prototyping` it is first necessary for developers to outline the details of the overall application, including its attributes
{: .prompt-tip }

## [Task 4] SDLC Phases Part 2

#### What phase focuses on handling issues or bugs reported by end-users?
```text
Operations and Maintenance
```
{: .nolineno }
{: file="Answer:" }

> Developers in `Operations and Maintenance` stage must move into maintenance mode and begin practising any activities required to handle issues reported by end-users.
{: .prompt-tip }

#### What phase involves releasing new versions of software?
```text
Deployment
```
{: .nolineno }
{: file="Answer:" }

> After testing, the overall design for the software starts to come together, and different modules or configurations are integrated into the primary source code. That stage is called `Deployment`.
{: .prompt-tip }

#### What phase ensures software meets the standards defined in the requirements phase?
```text
Testing
```
{: .nolineno }
{: file="Answer:" }

> Testers in `testing` phase will identify and report detailed bugs from test case execution and log the system's performance compared to its requirements.
{: .prompt-tip }

## [Task 5] Keep CALMS

#### What does CALMS stand for?
```text
Culture, Automation, Lean, Measurement, Sharing
```
{: .nolineno }
{: file="Answer:" }

> <https://www.atlassian.com/devops/frameworks/calms-framework>
{: .prompt-tip }

## [Task 6] DevOps Metrics

#### What 2 metrics are used to measure deployment agility?
```text
Deployment speed and frequency
```
{: .nolineno }
{: file="Answer:" }

> You can measure deployment agility by combining `deployment speed and frequency`.
{: .prompt-tip }

#### What is an essential rate for engineers in Production environments to know if code meets security requirements?
```text
Failure rate
```
{: .nolineno }
{: file="Answer:" }

> Tracking and reporting `failure rates` are essential for ensuring new code releases meet security requirements.
{: .prompt-tip }

#### What is the measurement for recovery time after a failure?
```text
MTTR
```
{: .nolineno }
{: file="Answer:" }

> When a partial or total service interruption occurs, the mean time to recovery (`MTTR`) is measured.
{: .prompt-tip }

## [Task 7] Production of the Droids

#### What is the flag that you receive once you have doubled the empire's investment?
```text
THM{Ruler.of.the.SDLC.Droids}
```
{: .nolineno }
{: file="Answer:" }

> Try your best at first! Clue: When you will keep the number of developers low, and number of sprint high, then you can win the game.
